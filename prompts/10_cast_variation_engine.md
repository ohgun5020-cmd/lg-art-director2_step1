```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 캠페인 타임라인 컨트롤
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[PRIORITY CHECK]
1. Is [CAMPAIGN_TARGET_DATE] specified?
   → YES: Use Target Date for season calculation (★★★ Priority)
   → NO: Use System Current Date (Fallback)

[SCENARIO EXAMPLE]
• Current Date: Dec 2025 (Winter)
• Campaign Target: "July 2026"
• Result: Force [SUMMER] styling regardless of current weather

[USER INPUT PATTERNS]
├── "7월 캠페인용" → CAMPAIGN_TARGET_DATE = July
├── "내년 여름용" → CAMPAIGN_TARGET_DATE = June-Aug next year
├── "S/S 시즌" → CAMPAIGN_TARGET_DATE = March-May
├── "F/W 시즌" → CAMPAIGN_TARGET_DATE = Sept-Nov
└── 미지정 → Current system date

[AUTO-DETECTION LOGIC]
1. Check CAMPAIGN_TARGET_DATE first
2. If not set → Get current system date
3. Identify selected city
4. Check TROPICAL EXCEPTION list (§3.5)
5. If NOT tropical → Determine hemisphere, calculate season
6. Apply climate-appropriate styling

[PROMPT INJECTION]
"Simulating [TARGET_MONTH] atmosphere, [SEASON] lighting conditions,
foliage state corresponding to [TARGET_MONTH] in [CITY]."
```

## §3.2 HEMISPHERE MAPPING

```
NORTHERN (Standard seasons):
- ALL European cities
- Mexico (non-coastal)

SOUTHERN (Inverted):
- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Peru

EQUATORIAL/TROPICAL (§3.5):
- Colombia, Caribbean, Mexico coastal, Central America
```

---

## §3.3 SEASON CALCULATION

```
NORTHERN:
Dec-Feb = WINTER | Mar-May = SPRING
Jun-Aug = SUMMER | Sep-Nov = AUTUMN

SOUTHERN (Inverted):
Dec-Feb = SUMMER | Mar-May = AUTUMN
Jun-Aug = WINTER | Sep-Nov = SPRING
```

---

## §3.3A SEASON LIGHTING METADATA (Step 2/3 상속)

```
[WINTER]
• Sun angle: Low
• Light: Cool daylight, long shadows
• Interior: Warm fill to avoid cold clinical mood

[SUMMER]
• Sun angle: High
• Light: Strong direct sunlight, short shadows
• Interior: Bright ambient bounce, high clarity

[SPRING]
• Sun angle: Mid
• Light: Soft diffused daylight, gentle contrast
• Interior: Fresh natural greens, mild warmth

[AUTUMN]
• Sun angle: Mid-low
• Light: Warm amber daylight, elongated shadows
• Interior: Golden hour tone, cozy contrast

[INHERITANCE RULE]
Step 2/3는 위 메타데이터를 LIGHTING MATCH에 반영한다.
```
